# Badshah Store: Status

Start here in every new chat. Update this file at the end of every slice (see "Slice closeout checklist" below).

## Where we are

Phase 1 (scaffold) is done. Phase 2 (catalogue and inventory) is in progress. Last finished slice: 13i (documentation sync). Next slice: 14 (ProductImage and media storage).

Terminology: phase numbers come from the build plan in `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` section 9. Where section 1 of that brief says "Phase 2 adds pan-India shipping", it means a later business phase, which is Phase 8 in the build plan.

## What is built

- Accounts: custom user model, login by phone (Phase 1).
- Core: abstract `TimeStampedModel` and `ArchivableModel` (Slice 12).
- Catalog: `Brand`, `Category` (a tree through `parent`), `Product` and `ProductVariant`, with admin (variants editable on the product page), factories and tests (Slices 12 and 13). Pricing helpers in `apps/catalog/services.py` (Slice 13c).
- Everything else in `docs/architecture.md` is target design only; the other app folders are empty shells.

## Slice log

| Slice | What changed |
| --- | --- |
| 1 to 10 | Phase 1 scaffold: settings split, Docker Compose, CI, pre-commit, custom user model, health endpoint, README, ADRs up to D35. |
| 11 | Removed the no-op `USE_X_FORWARDED_PROTO` setting (D36); README note about shared compose containers. |
| 12 | `core` base models; `Brand` and `Category`; admin, factories, tests; ASCII-only slugs (D37, D38). |
| 13 | `Product` and `ProductVariant` with database check constraints; admin with variant inline; pricing helpers; tests (D39, D40). |
| 13d | `docs/open_questions.md` updated with Phase 2 items. |
| 13e to 13i | Documentation sync: this file, ADRs D37 to D40, architecture, README, new open questions. |

## Remaining Phase 2 slices

14. ProductImage and media storage (local in dev; validate upload type and size).
15. Inventory models (InventoryMovement ledger, optional Supplier). See "Decide before Slice 15".
16. Inventory services (receive_stock, adjust_stock, select_for_update, concurrency tests, integrity-check command). REVIEW CAREFULLY.
17. AuditLog in core (price and stock changes). REVIEW CAREFULLY.
18. Inventory admin (receive and adjust actions, read-only movement history, low-stock and expiry views).
19. CSV export (service plus admin action).
20. CSV import with a validation report (dry run, then commit). REVIEW CAREFULLY.
21. Bulk price update admin action (uses the audit log).
22. Seed command (about 100 realistic SKUs loaded through the importer; idempotent).
23. Storefront listing, category and brand pages.
24. Filters (HTMX).
25. Product detail page (variants, savings, FSSAI info, JSON-LD).
26. Search service (PostgreSQL full-text and trigram behind an interface).
27. Search-as-you-type UI.
28. Phase 2 wrap-up (docs, ADRs, README, smoke test, Python recap).

StockReservation stays in Phase 3.

## Decide before Slice 15

Claude proposes, the owner confirms; record the outcome as ADR D41.

1. Current stock: derive it as the sum of movements (what `docs/architecture.md` says) instead of a cached StockLevel table. Add a cache later only if it is slow.
2. Batch and expiry: optional batch number and expiry date on received stock only; no first-expiry-first-out logic (the brief asks for expiry and batch tracking).
3. Supplier: a minimal optional record (name, phone, notes) on purchases.
4. Low-stock threshold: an optional number per variant; no alert when blank.

## Known gaps

- Category tree cycles are not prevented (nothing stops A to B to A). Add validation before Slice 23.
- `Invoice` and `Address` models are in the brief but not yet in the data model of `docs/architecture.md`; design them before Phase 3 (addresses) and Phase 5 (invoices).
- Rounding rules and HSN format are defaults awaiting the CA (see `docs/open_questions.md`); they must be confirmed before invoices are issued (Phase 5).

## How we work

- The agent (Freebuff) never touches `.env` and never runs commands. Every prompt ends with a STOP line, and the agent shows the diff and stops.
- A prompt may create up to 3 new files (full text given) or make exact-match edits to existing files. Each OLD text must appear exactly once, or the agent changes nothing.
- The agent edits settings or `pyproject.toml` only if the prompt names them. After any `pyproject.toml` edit, run the TOML check.
- Check the real `git diff` and `--stat`, not the agent's pasted diff. Commit in small steps after `git status` and `git diff --stat`.
- Every commit message starts with the slice id, for example `Slice 14a: Add ProductImage model`.
- Windows 11, Command Prompt. Python and Django idioms are explained as we go, because the owner is new to Python.
- Business questions nobody can answer yet go into `docs/open_questions.md` with the default in use; work continues unless the answer cannot be changed later.

Everyday commands (they run inside the container):

- `docker compose exec web python manage.py check`
- `docker compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations <app> --name <short_name>`
- `docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate`
- `docker compose exec web python -m pytest -q`

## Lessons

- Agent reports can be wrong: invented text, inconsistent line numbers, even checking the wrong file name. Verify key facts with `findstr`, `type`, `git ls-files` and `git diff`.
- The questions file is `docs/open_questions.md` (underscore).
- Django's Unicode slug check rejects Devanagari vowel signs (D37).
- Rewriting a long file in one prompt corrupted it once; use exact-match edits.
- On this Windows PC `git push` needed `git config --global http.sslBackend schannel`.
- Pre-commit may reformat files; run `git add -u` and commit again.

## Slice closeout checklist

1. Tests pass (`docker compose exec web python -m pytest -q`), `manage.py check` is clean and `makemigrations --check --dry-run` says no changes.
2. Commit with the slice id, push, and confirm CI is green.
3. Update this file: last finished slice, what is built, the slice log, remaining slices, known gaps.
4. Add an ADR to `docs/decisions.md` for every new decision (next free number), noting where it narrows the brief.
5. Update `docs/architecture.md` only if the target design changed.
6. Update `docs/open_questions.md`: new doubts, and answers received.
7. Update `README.md` only if setup or commands changed.
8. Commit the docs as `Slice <n>: Update docs`.
9. Start a new chat: attach `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `docs/STATUS.md`, add other docs only when the next slice touches them, and say "Continue at Slice <next>".
